# Amazon_Fake_Product_Identifier

Amazon is a very large online retailing platform and has become increasingly important to the sales and
distribution plans of brands in various categories. However, since Amazon is a platform that allows third-party
selling, brands are subject to risks of counterfeiting or gray market selling. The top questions brands ask are:

1) To what extent is the brand susceptible to the risk of counterfeiting and gray market selling?
2) What factors increase the risk of becoming a target of gray market sellers?

The project is about identifying Fake products being sold on Amazon Ecommerce website using Natural Language Processing and Machine learning models in Python.
